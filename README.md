# Tumera
 Yet another frontend for LLM, written using .NET and WinUI 3

## Just, why?
 Partly because I wanted to learn C# and WinUI 3, and partly because there were no frontends that are simple enough for an idiot like me while having Windows 11-styled Fluent UI.

 This is my first proper C# app and as such its code is a horrible mess. Don't worry though, it will get better over time, surely...

## Features
 At the moment, my goal is to get all basic features that you can expect from a frontend fully developed and stabilized. The app itself is currently in alpha state meaning it's not ***yet*** ready for daily or production use. Expect bugs, crashes, missing features and so much more.

# Building
 Open the solution in Visual Studio and build it there, simple as that.

 *Expect more detailed instructions soon(tm)*
